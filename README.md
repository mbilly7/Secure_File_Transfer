## TODO's

### Database:

Adding Contacts

Contact already exists

Read all contacts from file

### Security:

Too many attempts -> lockout

Clean up data / encrypt data

### Bugs:

Checking Password - use hash

getPassword() 1x or 2x depending on login or register

### Others:

Asterisks for passwords (like PDF)

Login - distinguish between incorrect pwd, incorrect email?
